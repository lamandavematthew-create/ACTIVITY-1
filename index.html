Helloww Behbyy, I know this isn't the most romantic time and way for me to express my love for you, considering the distance between the two of us. But still, I want to show it in a way that would show my effort and sincerity, given that I cannot say this in person. I really really really like you po (hindi halata nohh).\n\n
You are genuinely one of the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. The way you make me smile, feel calm, feel loved, and feel understood. You make ordinary days feel special without even trying, and even though we are so far away from each other. So will you celebrate this special day po with me?? Being that you are the most special person to me and I want make this day even more special, for you and for me.
\n\n
Making this took a while po so I wont make this longer na and I would want to know your answer po behbyy<3^^
Sooo Behbyyy...`;
